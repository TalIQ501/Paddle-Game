# PyGame Paddle

This is a simple game made using PyGame, where a player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen. The ball currently spawns at the top-left corner of the screen and moves downward towards the right. The objective is to prevent the ball from falling down. The ball changes its vertical direction by colliding with the top of the screen or with the paddle, and horizontally when it hits the edge on either side.
In addition, small blocks spawn every few intervals which collapse when they collide with the ball and cause the ball to change vertical direction. Hitting a block increases the score by 1.

# Future

- Object-oriented system for the blocks
- Including new blocks with varied behaviour, such as having a "health", or affecting ball velocity and paddle velocity
